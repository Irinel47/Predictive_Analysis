Pricing prediction based on multiple regression 

Price prediction Excel document based on multiple regression function Y=B1*X1+B2*X2+...+Bn*Xn, where Y is the dependent variable (total price) and the X-es
are the independent ones (quantity).

The analysis is based on Excel's regression with a first case where the intercept's P-value was greater that 0.05 so the null-hypothesis of a no correlation
beetwen the dependent and independet variables was rejected and a second case where we exclude A products because there are bigger variations in data so we
can get an outcome based on the null-hypothesis (where there is no correlation beetwen Y and X-es).
